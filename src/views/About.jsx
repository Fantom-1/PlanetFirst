        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          We are a team dedicated to building smarter, data-driven solutions for sustainable metals management.
          Our mission is to make Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and circularity insights accessible to industries,
          enabling them to reduce environmental impact while creating more resource-efficient systems.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Our Platform</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Our platform is an AI-powered software tool that helps organizations understand the full journey of metals —
          from extraction and processing to product use and end-of-life. It not only measures the environmental footprint
          but also identifies opportunities for reuse, recycling, and circular economy pathways.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-2">
          By simplifying complex analysis, it empowers engineers, decision-makers, and sustainability professionals to make
          smarter choices without requiring deep expertise in LCA.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Why It Matters</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Metals like aluminium, copper, and steel are essential for modern life — powering energy systems, infrastructure,
          and technology. However, traditional production models often lead to high carbon emissions, depletion of natural
          resources, and valuable materials ending up as waste.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-2">
          Our platform helps shift from a linear “take–make–dispose” model to a circular “reduce–reuse–recycle” model,
          where resources are kept in use longer, and waste is minimized.
